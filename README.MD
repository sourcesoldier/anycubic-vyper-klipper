# Klipper configuration Anycubic Vyper

## My current (hardware) setup
When I got my stock Anycubic Vyper printer, I decided to upgrade the firmware to use Klipper and unlock so much more speed, accuracy and quality. 

Here is the current setup I'm running (which is also the base for the configuration settings)
- Stock Anycubic Vyper hardware
- Klipper Firmware, simple and revertable upgrade through SD-Card
- Klipper/Mainsail Host running on a Raspeberry Pi 3 (rev. 1.2) with WiFi enabled
- ADXL345 Sensor that I temporary mount to messure the resonanz frequency of the printer whenever I change the location of the printer.
- I use a Tasmoto enabled smart plug to switch on the physical printer, whenever I need to print.

## Slicer setup
I've recently switched to using **SuperSlicer** with my Klipper/Mainsail setup as it allows me to better control all the parameters down to a filament level. I'll soon post some of my profiles here ....
